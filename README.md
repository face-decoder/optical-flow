# Optical Flow

This repository focuses on analyzing facial micro-expressions using optical flow techniques. The goal of this project is to capture subtle and rapid facial movements between video frames that are often difficult to detect visually.

Optical flow is used to estimate pixel-level motion patterns, enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle movements relevant to micro-expression research and affective computing.
